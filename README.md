# tree-sitter-mscgen

Grammar for MscGen and Xù - two DSL's for describing sequence charts.  

## :rotating_light: WORK IN PROGRESS :rotating_light:

Just pushed this to GH as a backup - if you'd like to use it (really??) be patient for a few days
a first version should be done in a few days (writing this on 2018-11-26), given the time 
it took me to write a similar tree-sitter for state-machine-cat.
